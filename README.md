Banno Evaluation App
=================================

To run locally, copy `conf/deploy.sample.conf` to `conf/deploy.conf` and update that file with working Twitter API keys.  After that, `sbt start`.

View `conf/routes` for the available HTTP endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:9000/average`).  In addition, statistics will be logged to STDOUT every 30 seconds.

Tests can be run with `sbt test`.
